<h1>MAMMALS COLLECTED BY DR. W. L. ABBOTT
ON THE NATUNA ISLANDS.</h1>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Gerrit S. Miller, Jr.</span></p>


<p>About three months during the spring and summer of 1900
were spent by Dr. W. L. Abbott in exploring the Natuna
Islands in the South China Sea.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Specimens were collected at
the following localities: Pulo Midei, or Low Island (May 23-26),
Pulo Seraia (May 29), Sirhassen Island (June 1-10), Pulo
Subi (June 12-13), Pulo Lingung (June 17-19), Bunguran, or
Great Natuna Island (June 24-July 31) and Pulo Laut, or
North Natuna Island (August 5-13). About 265 mammals
were obtained, all of which have been presented to the United
States National Museum. This paper contains an account of
these, and is published here by permission of the Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<p>Two extensive collections of mammals had been made on
the Natuna Islands previous to Dr. Abbott's visit, the first by
Mr. A. Everett during September and October, 1893, the second
by Mr. Ernest Hose during July, August, September and
October, 1894. These have formed, either wholly or in part, the
basis of several papers,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
which constitute the literature relating to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the mammals of the islands.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Twenty-eight land mammals have
been recorded as actually represented by specimens, though
several others are mentioned which the collectors ascertained to
occur. Dr. Abbott secured forty-four species, but failed to obtain
seven<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
of those previously taken. The total number of
mammals collected on the islands thus becomes fifty-one. This
increase is due, in part to the recognition of a larger number of
insular forms than has been admitted by previous writers, but
also to a considerable extent to the actual addition of species
not hitherto taken. Species new in the latter sense are distinguished
in the present paper by absence of reference to previous
records.</p>

<p>In regard to the faunal relationships of the Natunas, whether
predominantly Bornean or Peninsular, about which much has
been written,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
it may be said that this collection, together with
much of the other work recently done by Dr. Abbott, tends to
show that there is greater general uniformity in the mammalian
fauna of Borneo, the Malay Peninsula, and the intervening
islands than has been hitherto supposed. It seems unprofitable
therefore to offer conjectures as to the probability of greater
nearness of the Natuna mammals as a whole to those of Borneo
or to those of the Malay Peninsula.</p>

<h2>MANIS JAVANICA Desmarest.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">1895. <i>Manis javanica</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> and <span class="smcap">Hartert</span>,
Novitates Zoologic√¶, <span class="smcap">II</span>, p.
492. December, 1895 (Bunguran).</p></blockquote>

<p>An adult male was taken on Bunguran, June 24, 1900. Total
length 914; head and body 508; tail 406.</p>


<h2>TRAGULUS BUNGURANENSIS sp. nov.</h2>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult male (skin and skull) No. 104604 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Bunguran Island, North Natunas, July 9,
1900. Original number, 547.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Color pattern essentially as in <i>Tragulus nigricans</i>
Thomas, from Balabac. Size equal to that of <i>T. canescens</i> from the
Malay Peninsula, therefore much greater than in the Balabac animal.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;Back uniform ochraceous, fading to buff on sides, the hairs
everywhere gray at base. Both back and sides everywhere darkened
by black hair tips, but these never sufficiently abundant to produce
a dark shading in excess of the ochraceous. The relative proportion
of the dark wash to the light under color is precisely the same as in
<i>Tragulus canescens</i> and <i>T. napu</i> (from Linga Island) but the black
is less conspicuous than in the Bornean form of <i>T. napu</i>. Legs, except
white area on inner side, like back but slightly brighter and less
shaded with black. Entire dorsal and lateral surface of neck clear
black to base of hairs, a few ochraceous specks visible on close scrutiny,
particularly at sides near throat markings. On shoulders this
black area fades abruptly into color of back; on head it passes forward
between ears and eyes nearly to muzzle. Cheek, region between
eye and ear, and line extending forward over eye to muzzle and separating
black median stripe from naked loral space, ochraceous, essentially
like that of legs. Throat markings as in <i>Tragulus nigricans</i>,
but white stripes apparently even more restricted. Region occupied
by posterior white stripes black, continuous with that of neck, but distinctly
speckled with ochraceous. Region occupied by anterior
stripes ochraceous, continuous with that of cheeks and somewhat less
pure and more speckled with black. White stripes as follows: (<i>a</i>)
One on each side of naked chin area. These are about 50 mm.
in length and never more than 10 mm. in breadth, but occasionally so
narrow as to break up into two or more spots. They are separated
from naked chin patch by an ochraceous stripe slightly broader than
the white. Chin area narrowly and discontinuously bordered with
white, especially in front. (<i>b</i>) Two posterior lateral stripes varying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
from 50 mm. to 80 mm. in length, and never more than 12 mm. wide.
They are strongly convergent anteriorly, and sometimes nearly joined
together in front by a median spot. These white stripes are always
separated from the anterior stripes by an ochraceous median area
varying from 10 mm. to 25 mm. in width. (<i>c</i>) A median stripe
lying between the posterior lateral stripes. Posteriorly this stripe is
as wide as the lateral stripes, but it quickly narrows and sometimes
disappears at middle of latter, though usually represented again by
the median spot already referred to. In none of the specimens is this
stripe broad and continuous anteriorly to level of front of lateral
stripes as in Nehring's figure of the throat markings of <i>T.
nigricans</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Collar narrow, ochraceous grizzled with black. It is seldom more
than 25 mm. in width; therefore much narrower than indicated by
Nehring's figure. Behind the collar is a whitish gray median area
continuous laterally with narrow light stripe down inner side of fore
legs. This light area is sometimes divided by a dark median line
joining collar with buff of belly. Belly and chest buff, essentially
like that of sides, with which it forms no contrast in color. As on
the sides the buff is clouded by black hair tips, but the hairs are
scarcely if at all gray at base. On chest the dark hair tips tend to
form a median stripe, which is sometimes sharply defined and continuous
with the ochraceous line occasionally dividing white of breast.
A clear whitish area slightly larger and better defined than that of
breast occupies region between hind legs. It is continuous with white
stripe down inner side of hind legs. This stripe is usually divided on
thigh by encroachment of the surrounding ochraceous. Tail silky
white below and at tip, essentially like back above.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;The skull of <i>Tragulus bunguranensis</i> fully equals that of
<i>T. canescens</i> in size, and distinctly exceeds that of the Bornean form
of <i>T. napu</i>. It is much larger than that of <i>T. nigricans</i>, which
proves to be a medium sized species like <i>T. rufulus</i>. In general form
the skull agrees so closely with that of <i>Tragulus canescens</i> that it is
only to be distinguished by its slightly greater relative breadth and
smaller, less inflated audital bull√¶. As compared with the skull of
<i>Tragulus nigricans</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
that of <i>T. bunguranensis</i> is much larger (distance
from back of occiput to front of canine 103 instead of 92, zygomatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
breadth 53 instead of 45), and the braincase is more conspicuously
ridged for muscular attachment. That part of the braincase immediately
above posterior root of zygoma is more conspicuously inflated.
Otherwise I can detect no salient differences in the skulls of the two
animals.</p>

<p><i>Teeth.</i>&mdash;The teeth are uniformly larger than those of <i>Tragulus nigricans</i>,
but in form they present no characters of importance. As
compared with <i>T. canescens</i> the premolars both above and below are
conspicuously more robust, a character in which the Bunguran animal
agrees with the Bornean form of <i>Tragulus napu</i>.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: total length 647;
head and body 571; tail vertebr√¶ 76; hind foot 146; hind foot without
hoofs 128. Average and extremes of five adults from the type
locality: total length 643 (628-673); head and body 566 (558-584);
tail vertebr√¶ 77 (70-89); hind foot 142 (140-146); hind foot without
hoofs 126 (124-128).</p>

<p>Cranial measurements of type: greatest length 114; basal length
107; basilar length 100; occipito-nasal length 106; length of nasals
32; diastema 13 (9);<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
zygomatic breadth 52 (46); least interorbital
breadth 33 (28); greatest breadth of braincase above base of zygomata
38 (33); mandible 91 (78); maxillary toothrow (alveoli) 38 (34);
mandibular toothrow (alveoli) 44 (39); anterior upper premolar
7 √ó 3.8 (6.4 √ó 3); middle lower premolar 7.2 √ó 3 (5.8 √ó 2.4).</p>

<p><i>Weight.</i>&mdash;Weight of type 3.8 kg.; of two other males 3.6 kg. each.
Two adult females weigh respectively 3.6 kg. and 4.2 kg.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Six, all from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Tragulus bunguranensis</i> is so distinct from the other
known species as to require no detailed comparisons.</p>


<h2>TRAGULUS sp.</h2>

<p>Two specimens from Sirhassen Island are too immature for determination.
Apparently they represent a member of the <i>napu</i> group,
allied to that occurring in Borneo. The throat markings show no approach
to those of <i>Tragulus bunguranensis</i>.</p>

<h2>TRAGULUS PALLIDUS sp. nov.</h2>

<blockquote>

<span class="smcap">Hartert</span>, Novitates Zoologic√¶, <span class="smcap">II</span>,
p. 492. December, 1895 (part, specimen from Pulo Laut).</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult female (skin and skull) No. 104616 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Pulo Laut, North Natuna Islands, August
11, 1900. Original number 625.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Smaller than <i>Tragulus javanicus</i> from Borneo or
Bunguran and very pale in color. Black clouding of upper parts inconspicuous,
but dark nape band well defined.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;Back and sides light ochraceous-buff everywhere clouded
by the blackish hair-tips, but these never in excess, except perhaps
along middle of back and across lumbar region. Flanks, shoulders,
neck, outer surface of legs and narrow line dividing color of sides
from that of belly pale ochraceous. Nape band clear black, sharply
defined from color of sides but quickly fading into that of shoulders.
Top of head dull dark brown. A faint pale stripe over and in front of
eye. Throat markings normal, the dark bands like neck. Collar very
narrow. Under parts and inner surface of legs white. A faint yellowish
shade along middle of belly. Tail white beneath and at the
tip, ochraceous faintly shaded with brown above.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;The skull of the type, though fully adult and with all the
teeth distinctly worn, is smaller than in Bunguran specimens so young
that the posterior molars are still below the rim of the alveoli. In
form, however, it shows no marked peculiarities, though in general it
appears to be somewhat broader in proportion to its length than that
of the Bunguran animal.</p>

<p><i>Teeth.</i>&mdash;Teeth as in specimens of <i>Tragulus javanicus</i> from Bunguran
except that the premolars, both above and below, are shorter and
broader, a difference which may prove to be an individual peculiarity
only.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: Total length
539; head and body 444; tail vertebr√¶ 95; hind foot 107; hind
foot without hoofs 95.</p>

<p>Cranial measurements of type: Greatest length 90
(94<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>); basal
length 83 (87); basilar length 78 (82); occipito-nasal length 83
(89); length of nasals 25 (29.6); diastema 9.2 (9.8); zygomatic
breadth 41.4 (40); least interorbital breadth 26.4 (25); breadth of
braincase over roots of zygomata 29.4 (28.4); mandible 72 (75);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
maxillary toothrow (alveoli) 31.6 (34); first upper premolar 6.4
√ó 2.8 (7 √ó 2.6); mandibular toothrow (alveoli) 35.8 (38).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;One, the type.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This is a pallid form of <i>Tragulus javanicus</i>, a species
which apparently shows very little tendency to become differentiated
into local races. The characters of the Pulo Laut animal were pointed
out by Thomas and Hartert in 1895.</p>


<h2>SUS NATUNENSIS sp. nov.</h2>

<blockquote>

<span class="smcap">Hartert</span>, Novitates Zoologic√¶, <span class="smcap">II</span>, p. 492. December,
1895 (Bunguran).</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult female (skin and skull) No. 104856 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Pulo Laut, North Natuna Islands, August 6,
1900. Original number 609.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Externally much like the Tenasserim form of <i>Sus
cristatus</i>, but smaller; body brownish in marked contrast with black
legs and face; skull conspicuously shorter and broader.</p>

<p><i>Fur.</i>&mdash;The fur throughout consists of bristles with no admixture of
softer hairs. The bristles are everywhere less stiff than in the
Tenasserim pig, but the difference is most noticeable in the mane,
which, though well developed (about 80 mm. in length), is composed
of bristles very slightly coarser than those of the surrounding parts,
and of not more than half the diameter of the corresponding hairs in
females of <i>S. cristatus</i>. Muzzle, chest, belly and ears nearly bare.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;General color black, clear and unmixed with brown on
legs, throat, and face, but elsewhere heavily overlaid with brownish
buff, particularly on back and sides. The brownish wash ceases abruptly
just in front of ears, leaving the face and cheeks clear black.
A conspicuous dull buff streak 100 mm. long and about half as wide
at middle extends back from angle of mouth to level of posterior canthus
of eye. It is sharply outlined above by black of cheeks, and below
by that of chin. A faint buffy mark beneath eye. Tail like
back.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;The skull while much shorter than that of <i>Sus cristatus</i>
from Tenasserim is actually broader. As a result the width across
postorbital processes is contained only about three times in occipito-nasal
length, as opposed to nearly four times in the related species.
Similarly the zygomatic breadth slightly exceeds one half of the basilar
length, while in <i>Sus cristatus</i> it is less than half. Width of palate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
between middle molars almost exactly one sixth distance from posterior
edge of palate to front of premaxillaries (measured along median
line). In <i>Sus cristatus</i> the palatal width is contained nearly
seven times in the same distance. Dorsal profile of skull slightly concave
near base of nasals. Zygomata heavier and deeper than in <i>Sus
cristatus</i>. Audital bull√¶ noticeably smaller and less inflated than in
the Tenasserim pig. Mandible shorter and much more robust than
that of <i>Sus cristatus</i>, the outward bulge of the ramus a little behind
middle of toothrow greatly accentuated.</p>

<p><i>Teeth.</i>&mdash;As the teeth of the two specimens of <i>Sus natunensis</i> are
much worn, while those of the only skulls of <i>Sus cristatus</i> at hand are
not fully grown, it is impossible to make any accurate comparisons.
The smaller size of the Natuna pig's teeth is, however, evident for the
length of the entire upper toothrow does not equal that of <i>S. cristatus</i>
without the posterior molar. The crown of the middle upper molar
appears to be more nearly square in outline than that of the Tenasserim
pig, but in the very different condition of the specimens it
would be unsafe to assume that this character is constant.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type; total length
1294; head and body 1117; tail vertebr√¶ 177; height at shoulder
558; hind foot 220 (170); ear from meatus 100; width of ear 75.</p>

<p>Cranial measurement of type: greatest length 295
(332<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>); occipito-nasal
length 282 (316); basal length 245 (275); basilar length
235 (263); length of nasals 135 (157); width of both nasals together
posteriorly 34 (33); median length of bony palate 168 (183); width of
bony palate at middle of second molar 30 (29); breadth between tips of
postorbital processes 87 (87); least interorbital breadth 64 (65); zygomatic
breadth 130 (133); occipital breadth 58 (62); occipital depth
100 (103); least depth of rostrum between canine and incisor 33 (39);
mandible 225 (232); depth of mandible through coronoid process 104
(110); depth of ramus at front of first molar 40 (41); maxillary
toothrow to front of canine (alveoli) 113
(131<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>); mandibular toothrow
to front of canine (alveoli) 120 (138); crown of first upper molar
12 √ó 13 (18 √ó 16); crown of second upper molar 18 √ó 18 (22 √ó 16).</p>

<p><i>Weight.</i>&mdash;Weight of type, 40 kg.; weight of adult female from
Pulo Lingung, 35 kg.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Two, one from Pulo Laut, the other from
Pulo Lingung.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;While the two specimens agree in all essential characters
they differ in numerous minor details. The skin from Pulo Lingung
is somewhat darker than the type, but the difference is due to the shade
of the brown wash, not to any extension of the black. The skull of
this specimen is more rounded posteriorly than that of the type, and the
rostrum is shorter. Both specimens show conclusively that their relationships
are with the <i>Sus cristatus</i> of the Malay Peninsula and not
with the <i>S. longirostris</i> of Borneo, a case which finds an exact parallel
in the giant squirrels.</p>


<h2>MUS INTEGER sp. nov.</h2>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult male (skin and skull) No. 104837 U. S. National Museum.
Collected on Sirhassen Island, South Natunas, June 7, 1900.
Original number 455.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;A large robust species with coarse but not spinous
fur. Relationships with <i>Mus validus</i> Miller, from Trong, Lower
Siam, and <i>Mus m√ºlleri</i> Jentink from Sumatra. Differs from the
former in smaller size and in the absence of the anterior outer tubercle
of the last upper molar, and from the latter in larger size, and yellowish
brown (not white) underparts.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;Back and sides a fine grizzle of black and dull ochraceous
(the exact shade intermediate between the ochraceous and ochraceous-buff
of Ridgway), the two colors nearly equally mixed on back, but the
ochraceous in excess on sides. Underparts and inner surface of legs
buff. An ill defined drab-gray median line from throat to pubic region.
Head darker and more glossy than back, the cheeks distinctly washed
with gray. Lips and chin drab-gray. Feet an indefinite brown,
darker on metapodials. Ears essentially naked, dark brown. Tail
dark brown throughout. Underfur gray (Ridgway, pl. <span class="smcap">II</span>, No. 8), becoming
paler on under parts where it fades irregularly into the general
buff.</p>

<p><i>Fur.</i>&mdash;The fur is exactly as in <i>Mus validus</i>, that is the grooved
bristles are so slender that their true nature is not apparent without use
of lens. On middle of back the mass of the fur is about 17 mm. in
length, the long terete hairs scattered through it reaching about 30 mm.
On rump the fur is longer but not conspicuously so, and there is no
noticeable increase in length or abundance of the terete black hairs.</p>

<p><i>Tail, feet and mamm√¶.</i>&mdash;Tail slightly more coarsely scaled than in
<i>Mus validus</i>; 9 rings to the centimeter at middle. Hairs scarcely
noticeable except toward tip, where they somewhat exceed the breadth
of the rings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Feet heavy and robust. Thumb short, with a flat blunt nail. Soles
and palms naked, the former with six well developed tubercles, the
latter with five.</p>

<p>Mamm√¶, p. 2&mdash;2, i. 2&mdash;2 = 8.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;In general appearance the skull of <i>Mus integer</i> resembles
that of <i>Mus validus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
It is shorter (greatest length about 51 instead
of 55) and the rostrum is relatively broader and deeper. Audital
bull√¶ similar in form to those of <i>Mus validus</i>, but the surface less
irregular. Region between anterior bases of zygomata broader than
in <i>Mus validus</i> so that the arches are more nearly parallel.</p>

<p><i>Teeth.</i>&mdash;The teeth are relatively as well as actually smaller than in
<i>Mus validus</i> and the enamel pattern is normal, that is, the posterior
upper molar consists of two transverse folds, and an anterior internal

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult male (skin and skull) No. 104698 U. S. National Museum.
Collected on Bunguran Island, North Natunas, July 18, 1900.
Original number 574.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Externally similar to <i>Sciurus tenuis</i> though somewhat
smaller. Skull very much smaller and relatively broader than in
the related species.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;The color is exactly like that of <i>Sciurus tenuis</i> from Singapore.</p>

<p><i>Skull and teeth.</i>&mdash;Except that it appears to be broader throughout,
relatively to its length, the skull of <i>Sciurus procerus</i> is essentially a
miniature of that of <i>S. tenuis</i>, as the braincase shows none of the tendency
to increased depth characteristic of the Bornean animal. Ratio
of rostral depth to distance between middle of interparietal and lower
rim of audital bulla, 50. This ratio is 49 in <i>S. tenuis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult male (skin and skull) No. 104693 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Pulo Lingung off southern extremity of Bunguran,
North Natuna Islands, June 19, 1900. Original number 494.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Externally similar to <i>Sciurus natunensis</i> (Thomas),
but slightly larger (hind foot with claws 36 instead of 33.6). Skull
larger than that of <i>S. natunensis</i>, the audital bull√¶ much broader
anteriorly.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;The color is precisely as in <i>Sciurus natunensis</i>, and therefore
requires no detailed description.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;Skull larger than that of <i>Sciurus natunensis</i> (see measurements)
but not different in general form. The audital bull√¶ are,
however, readily distinguishable by the much greater development of
the anterior inner lobe. In <i>Sciurus natunensis</i> this lobe is so small
as scarcely to form any part of the general contour of the bulla. In
<i>S. lingungensis</i> it is nearly equal to the anterior outer lobe, together
with which it imparts a distinctly triangular outline to the ventral aspect
of the bulla.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: total length 229;
head and body 140; tail vertebr√¶ 89; hind foot 36 (33.7); ear from
meatus 12; ear from crown 7. A second specimen from the type locality
gives precisely the same measurements.</p>

mandibular toothrow (alveoli) 7 (7).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Two, both from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;While <i>Sciurus lingungensis</i> is scarcely distinguishable
from <i>S. natunensis</i> by external characters alone, size of the skull and
form of the audital bull√¶ are clearly diagnostic. Both species from
the Natunas are separated from the Bornean <i>S. lowi</i> Thomas by their
well developed ears, and shorter broader rostral portion of skull.</p>

September, 1894 (part, specimens from Sirhassen).</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult male (skin and skull) No. 104668 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Sirhassen Island, South Natunas, June 3,
1900. Original number 429.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Allied to <i>Sciurus notatus</i>, but considerably smaller
than the Bornean representative of the species. Colors very pale, the
under parts buff or cream-buff (Ridgway, pl. v, nos. 13 and 11) irregularly
tinged with gray.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;Entire dorsal surface of body and tail a fine grizzle of black
and cream-buff, the individual hairs black with two or three cream
buff rings. On tail the grizzle is less fine than on back, and it shows a
faint tendency to resolve itself into obscure cross bands. On sides of
body and on head the cream-buff brightens to buff. Cheeks and
muzzle buff, scarcely grizzled. Feet slightly yellower than sides,
under parts and inner surface of legs pale buff, palest anteriorly and
laterally (where it about matches the cream-buff of Ridgway) brightest
along median line. Under side of tail dull ochraceous-buff slightly
grizzled with black. Pencil not different from rest of tail. Between
the colors of sides and belly are the usual longitudinal stripes. The
outer of these is about 5 mm. in width, and cream-buff in color.
The inner is about twice as wide, and black, but much obscured by a
thick sprinkling of bluish gray hairs. Outer surface of ears concolor
with neck, inner surface like cheeks. The sprinkling of bluish gray
hairs on sides of belly extends irregularly forward to axilla and inner
side of front leg, occasionally to throat and chin.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;As compared with the Bornean form of <i>Sciurus notatus</i>,
the skull of <i>S. lutescens</i> is much smaller (greatest length about 45 instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of 50) the rostrum is relatively shorter and broader, and the
audital bull√¶ are less elongate antero-posteriorly. Teeth as in <i>Sciurus
notatus</i> except that they are uniformly smaller.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: total length 355;
head and body 177; tail vertebr√¶, 177; hind foot 45 (41). Average
and extremes of six specimens from the type locality: total length 356
(329-375); head and body 186 (177-196); tail vertebr√¶ 170 (152-178);
hind foot 43.8 (41-45); hind foot without claws 40.7 (39-42).</p>

(50.4)<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>; basal
length 39 (43); basilar length 36.4 (41); palatal length 20 (23);
palatal width between middle molars 6 (6); greatest length of nasals
13 (14.8); greatest width of both nasals together 6.6 (7); interorbital

26 (29); depth of braincase at anterior edge of basi-occipital 16 (16.8);
mandible 28 (30); maxillary toothrow (alveoli) 8 (9); mandibular
toothrow (alveoli) 8 (9).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Seven (one in alcohol), all from the type
locality.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This squirrel is recognizable among the members of the
<i>S. notatus</i> group by its light colors, and particularly by the pallor of the
under parts. In the latter characteristic it is approached by the form
inhabiting Pulo Laut, but with this exception it is unique among the
fulvous bellied species. The six specimens show no variation worthy
of note.</p>


<h2>SCIURUS SERAI√Ü sp. nov.</h2>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult male (skin and skull) No. 104660 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Pulo Seraia, South Natuna Islands, May 29,
1900. Original number 415.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Most nearly related to the small, pallid, <i>Sciurus
lutescens</i> from Sirhassen Island, but upper parts slightly less pale,
and under parts and pale side stripe buff-yellow, the former without
admixture of gray.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;Upper parts as in <i>Sciurus lutescens</i> except that the pale
bands on the hairs are more nearly buff than cream-buff. Tail essentially
as in <i>S. lutescens</i> but a shade less pale. Under parts buff-yellow
darkening irregularly to dull orange-buff. Dark side stripe broad and
well defined.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;The skull closely agrees with that of <i>Sciurus lutescens</i> in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
both size and form, though it is perhaps even broader in proportion to
its length. Teeth as in <i>S. lutescens</i>.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: total length 368;
head and body 197; tail vertebr√¶ 171; hind foot 44 (40). Average
and extremes of four specimens from the type locality: total length
347 (323-368); head and body 184 (171-197); tail vertebr√¶ 163
(152-171); hind foot 43.7 (43-45); hind foot without claws 40.1
(39.5-41).</p>

<p>Cranial measurements of type: greatest length 45; basal length
38.6; basilar length 36; zygomatic breadth 26.4; least interorbital
breadth 17; mandible 28; maxillary toothrow (alveoli) 8.6; mandibular
toothrow (alveoli) 8.6.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Four, all from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;As might be expected from the geographic position of
the island it inhabits, <i>Sciurus serai√¶</i> differs from the Bornean <i>S.
notatus</i> in much the same way as the Sirhassen representative of the
group. It is readily distinguishable from the Sirhassen animal by the
different color of the under parts. In color <i>Sciurus serai√¶</i> closely
resembles <i>S. abbottii</i> of the Tambelan Islands. The latter is, however,
a much larger animal, with a longer and relatively narrower skull.</p>


<h2>SCIURUS RUTILIVENTRIS sp. nov.</h2>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult male (skin and skull) No. 104658 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Pulo Midei (Low Island), South Natuna
Islands, May 24, 1900. Original number 405.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Size slightly greater than that of <i>Sciurus lutescens</i>
and <i>S. serai√¶</i>, but not equal to that of the Bornean or Bunguran representatives
of <i>S. notatus</i>. Color above as in <i>S. serai√¶</i>. Under
parts bright clear orange-rufous.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;Color exactly as in <i>Sciurus serai√¶</i> except that the pale
side stripe is light cream-buff and the under parts are bright orange
rufous. Tail without trace of red suffusion.</p>

<p><i>Skull and teeth.</i>&mdash;The skull and teeth are a trifle larger than in
<i>Sciurus lutescens</i> and <i>S. serai√¶</i>, but the difference is scarcely a
tangible one.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: Total length
368; head and body 190; tail vertebr√¶ 178; hind foot 45 (41).
Average and extremes of seven specimens from the type locality:
total length 356 (330-368); head and body 186 (178-190); tail
vertebr√¶ 173 (165-184); hind foot 45.5 (43-48); hind foot without
claws 42.2 (39.5-45).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Seven, all from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This squirrel is remarkable among the Natuna members
of the <i>S. notatus</i> group for the brilliant color of its under parts. In
this respect it surpasses all of the related forms with which I am acquainted.
The red color is, however, strictly confined to the body,
showing no tendency to spread to the tail as in <i>S. miniatus</i> of the Malay
Peninsula.</p>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult female (skin and skull) No. 104671 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Bunguran Island, North Natunas, June 22,
1900. Original number 498.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Size and general appearance both above and below as
in the Bornean form of <i>Sciurus notatus</i>, but red of under parts brighter,
and cheeks and chin distinctly less fulvous than surrounding parts.
Skull with broader, deeper braincase than in the Bornean animal.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;The color so closely resembles that of the Bornean <i>Sciurus
notatus</i> that no detailed description is necessary. Under parts ochraceous-rufous,
fading to tawny on throat, everywhere lighter and more
tinged with red than in the Bornean animal. In the latter the color
of the under parts extends forward to lips and also strongly suffuses the
cheeks and sides of head which are only a shade browner than the
throat and conspicuously more fulvous than top of head and sides of
neck. In <i>Sciurus rubidiventris</i> the cheeks and lips are noticeably
suffused with gray so that they form a distinct contrast with both throat,
top of head and sides of neck.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;The skull agrees in general size with that of the Bornean
animal, and is therefore much larger than in the three species from the
South Natunas. It is distinguishable by greater general breadth and
by the depth of the braincase, which perceptibly exceeds that of <i>S.
notatus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: total length 380;
head and body 209; tail vertebr√¶ 171; hind foot 49 (44.5). Averages

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;In both size and general color this squirrel more closely
resembles the Bornean representative of the group than it does either
of the three forms from the South Natunas. Its relationships, however,
appear to be rather with the race inhabiting Singapore Island
than with any of its near geographic allies, <i>Sciurus lautensis</i> excepted.</p>

<span class="smcap">Hartert</span>, Novitates Zoologic√¶, <span class="smcap">II</span>, p.
491. December, 1895 (part, specimens from Pulo Laut).</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult female (skin and skull) No. 104683 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Pulo Laut, North Natuna Islands, August 6,
1900. Original number 612.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Size slightly less than that of <i>Sciurus rubidiventris</i>
and color conspicuously pallid. Upper parts as in <i>S. lutescens</i>; lower
parts nearly as in <i>S. serai√¶</i> but rather less dull; pale side stripe much
less yellow than belly. Skull as in <i>Sciurus rubidiventris</i>.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;Upper parts and tail as in <i>Sciurus lutescens</i>. Cheeks
faintly washed with ochraceous-buff. Under parts and inner surface
of legs bright ochraceous-buff (distinctly more yellow than Ridgway's
pl. V, No. 10). Lateral stripes as in <i>S. lutescens</i> (not distinctly yellowish
as in <i>S. serai√¶</i>), but black band usually less sprinkled with gray.
Scarcely a trace of gray in axillary region or on sides of neck.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;The skull in all respects closely resembles that of <i>S. rubidiventris</i>
except that it is slightly smaller. Its large size and the correspondingly
large teeth readily distinguish it from that of the South
Natuna species.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: total length 375;
head and body 195; tail vertebr√¶ 180; hind foot 44 (41). Average
and extremes of nine specimens from the type locality; total length
363 (355-379); head and body 189 (171-196); tail vertebr√¶ 170
(165-183); hind foot 45 (44-46); hind foot without claws 42
(41-43).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Ten (one in alcohol), all from the type

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Though suggesting two of the small South Natuna
squirrels in color, <i>Sciurus lautensis</i> is obviously related to the dark
colored Bunguran form, with which it more nearly agrees in size.</p>

<p>Two specimens, Sirhassen, June 8, 1900.</p>

<p>This species, though related to <i>Ratufa ephippium</i>, with which it
agrees in color-scheme, is sharply differentiated by its small size and
cranial peculiarities. It is in no way closely allied to <i>Ratufa
bunguranensis</i> and <i>R. nanogigas</i>.</p>

<p>As compared with that of <i>Ratufa ephippium sandakanensis</i> Bonhote,
the skull in addition to its small size (greatest length 57 instead
of 65) differs in general narrowness, in the relatively greater breadth
of the nasal branches of the premaxillaries, and in the form of the
audital bull√¶. When the skull is held upside down and viewed from
behind the bull√¶ are seen to be narrower than in the Bornean animal
and to rise to a much greater height above the surface of the basi-occipital.</p>

<p>Thirteen specimens from Bunguran, all in various stages of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
change from the bleached winter coat to the summer pelage. In the
latter there is some color variation, mostly due to the greater or less
distinctness of the drab wash overlying the Prouts-brown or 'chocolate'
of the upper parts. Not only does the drab vary in amount in
different individuals, but on every specimen it is more noticeable when
the animal is viewed from in front. The drab wash is of the same
character as that in <i>Ratufa affinis</i>, though less conspicuous.</p>

<p>As Mr. Thomas has pointed out to me, after examining a specimen
of the latter, <i>Ratufa bunguranensis</i> is closely allied to <i>R. pyrsonota</i>.
Indeed its relationship to the Siamese species is much closer than to
the <i>R. ephippium</i> of Borneo. Together with <i>R. pyrsonota</i> the Bunguran
giant squirrel differs conspicuously from that of Borneo in its
narrow skull, lengthened audital bull√¶, dark feet, dark median line on
under surface of tail, and entirely brown back. From <i>R. pyrsonota</i>,
however, it is readily separable by its darker, less ochraceous color
both above and below, drab washed back, and by the much less distinct
annulation of the hairs of the dorsal surface.</p>


<h2>RATUFA NANOGIGAS (Thomas and Hartert).</h2>

<p>Four specimens, all from Pulo Laut, the type locality.</p>

<p>This strongly characterized dwarf species is allied to <i>Ratufa pyrsonota</i>
and <i>R. bunguranensis</i> with which it agrees in color scheme.
It is in no way closely related to the large Bornean <i>R. ephippium</i>.</p>


<h2>RATUFA ANGUSTICEPS sp. nov.</h2>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult male (skin and skull) No. 104646 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Pulo Lingung, off south coast of Bunguran,
June 17, 1900. Original number 481.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Externally like <i>Ratufa anamb√¶</i> and <i>R. melanopepla</i>.
Skull about equal to that of latter in length, but conspicuously narrower.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;As the color is precisely like that of <i>Ratufa anamb√¶</i> and
<i>R. melanopepla</i> it requires no description.</p>

<p><i>Skull and teeth.</i>&mdash;The skull is immediately recognizable by its general
narrowness, but particularly in the region of the anterior zygomatic
roots. Ratio of lachrymal breadth to greatest length, 39. In the other
black backed species it is about 42. Audital bull√¶ narrower and
more elongate than in <i>R. melanopepla</i>, and more elevated above level
of basi-occipital (when skull is held upside down). Lateral processes
of basi-occipital obsolete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Teeth as in the related species.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: total length 748;

toothrow (alveoli) 14.6 (14.4).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;One, the type.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;While this squirrel exactly resembles the other black
backed species with untufted ears, so far as external characters are
concerned, it seems to be well differentiated in cranial peculiarities.
No black backed <i>Ratufa</i> has hitherto been recorded from the Natunas.</p>


<h2>RHINOSCIURUS sp.</h2>

<p>An immature long-nosed squirrel was taken on Sirhassen Island,
June 4, 1900. In the absence of material for comparison I am unable
to determine the species. The genus is new to the islands.</p>


<h2>ARCTOGALIDIA INORNATA sp. nov.</h2>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
male (skin and skull) No. 104859 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Bunguran Island, North Natunas, June 23,
1900. Original number 502.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Much smaller than <i>Arctogalidia leucotis</i> from the
Malay Peninsula or <i>A. stigmatica</i> from Borneo (greatest length of
skull about 100 instead of 115) and in color paler than either, the dark
dorsal stripes obsolete in adult.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;General color of back and sides light silvery gray irregularly
suffused with buff and slightly darkened by blackish hair-tips and
by appearance at surface of hair-brown basal portion of fur. The
buff suffusion is least noticeable on back, slightly more apparent on
sides and flanks, and most evident on sides of neck, where it usually
brightens almost to buff-yellow in distinct contrast with surrounding
parts. On middle of back there is a trace of the middle dark stripe
of the three normally present in members of the genus. Head essentially
like back though somewhat more gray. Muzzle and ill-defined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
eye ring blackish. Cheeks and short median stripe on forehead dull
whitish gray. Under parts essentially like back, but buff tinge more
diffuse. Feet and ears dark brown. Tail like back but darkening
to uniform brown beyond middle.</p>

<p>Newly born young are clear bluish gray, with scarcely a tinge of
buff. The three black dorsal stripes are clearly defined and normal in
extent.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;In addition to its smaller size the skull differs from that of
the Bornean <i>Arctogalidia stigmatica</i> in the relatively larger braincase,
and less prominent audital bull√¶. The braincase is nearly as
broad as in the Bornean species, but the zygomatic width is distinctly
less. Audital bull√¶ less raised above level of basi-occipital when skull
is held upside down and viewed from behind. The sagittal crest,
though of normal development in very old individuals, is absent at an
age when it is well grown in the larger species. In <i>Arctogalidia leucotis</i>
and <i>A. stigmatica</i>, even in animals so young that the teeth are unworn
and all the sutures of the rostrum plainly visible, the sagittal
crest is a knife-like ridge extending from proencephalon to lambdoid
suture, and rising to a height of about 4 mm. over middle of braincase.
In much older individuals of <i>A. inornata</i>, with worn teeth and
nearly obliterated rostral sutures, the crest is represented by a low
ridge about 5 mm. wide over middle of braincase and flat or grooved
on top. At this stage it rises very inconspicuously above level of the
adjacent surface, from which it is distinguished more by the texture of
the bone than by actual form.</p>

<p><i>Teeth.</i>&mdash;The teeth are uniformly much smaller than in <i>Arctogalidia
leucotis</i> and <i>A. stigmatica</i>, but I can detect no important differences
in form.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: total length
1027; head and body 469; tail vertebr√¶ 558; hind foot 78 (73.) External
measurements of an adult female: total length 911; head and
body 431; tail vertebr√¶ 480; hind foot 77 (72).</p>

(5.4 √ó 6.4); crown of second lower molar 7 √ó 4.2 (8.4 √ó 5.4).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Seven (two young in alcohol and one skull
without skin), all from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Arctogalidia inornata</i> is so distinct from the previously
described species as to require no special comparisons. It is common
on Bunguran where it frequents the cocoanut trees, living for the most
part in the tops among the leaf stalks.</p>

1900. Original number 442.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;In general similar to Bornean specimens of <i>Tupaia
tana</i>, but smaller (hind foot 47 instead of 52, greatest length of skull
55 instead of 60), gray markings on head and shoulders less distinct,
and red of tail brighter. Rostral portion of skull less attenuate than
in <i>Tupaia tana</i>.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;The color so exactly resembles that of the common Bornean
<i>Tupaia tana</i> as to need no detailed description. Gray of head darker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
than in the Bornean animal and light shoulder markings less distinct
and sharply defined. Under side of tail light orange-rufous, darkening
to ferruginous toward edge. (In <i>T. tana</i> these colors are replaced by
dull ferruginous and hazel respectively.)</p>

<p><i>Skull and teeth.</i>&mdash;The skull is throughout much smaller than in
specimens of <i>Tupaia tana</i> from Borneo. In form it differs from
that of <i>T. tana</i> in less slender and elongate rostrum, narrower braincase
and slightly shorter audital bull√¶. Suborbital vacuity much

<h2>EMBALLONURA ANAMBENSIS Miller.</h2>

<p>Four specimens from Bunguran. These agree essentially with the
Anamba animal, but show some slight cranial peculiarities.</p>


<h2>PIPISTRELLUS SUBULIDENS sp. nov.</h2>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult female (in alcohol) No. 104758 U. S. National
Museum. Collected on Sirhassen Island, South Natunas, June 3,
1900.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Similar to <i>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</i> (Schreber) in
size, color and external form, but skull with broader rostrum, and inner
upper incisor without supplemental cusp.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;The skull is of the same size as that of <i>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</i>,
but the braincase is narrower and more elongate, and the rostrum
is very markedly shorter and broader. The great breadth of the
anterior portion of the skull involves also the palate and interpterygoid
space, both of which are noticeably wider than in <i>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</i>.
Audital bull√¶ slightly smaller than in the European species.</p>

<p><i>Teeth.</i>&mdash;The teeth are essentially as in <i>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</i>,
except that the inner upper incisor lacks the small supplemental cusp.
Mandibular teeth wider than those of <i>P. pipistrellus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: total length 76;
head and body 41; tail 33; tibia 14; foot 6; calcar 10; forearm
32.4; thumb 6; second digit 30; third digit 60; fourth digit 53;

4.2 (4.2); mandibular toothrow (exclusive of incisors) 4.8 (4.8).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Six (in alcohol), all from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;I am unable to identify this bat with any described
species. Externally it is practically identical with <i>Pipistrellus
pipistrellus</i> except that the color, so far as can be judged from specimens
preserved in alcohol, is more blackish. Internally it is readily
distinguished by the characters of the skull and teeth. From <i>Pipistrellus
abramus</i> it differs externally in smaller size, narrower ears,
and in the absence of any unusual development of the penis. The
incisors differ from those of <i>P. abramus</i> in the same manner as from
those of <i>P. pipistrellus</i>.</p>


<h2>HIPPOSIDEROS LARVATUS (Horsfield).</h2>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;In general like <i>Rhinolophus affinis</i> but much smaller.
Color uniform tawny brown. Muzzle with distinct supplemental
leaflets.</p>

<p><i>Muzzle.</i>&mdash;Muzzle and noseleaf precisely as in <i>Rhinolophus affinis</i>,
except that the ridge on muzzle beneath edge of horseshoe is developed
into a distinct supplemental leaflet resembling those present
in <i>Hipposideros</i>. In this respect <i>Rhinolophus spadix</i> resembles the

way peculiar in form.</p>

<p><i>Ears.</i>&mdash;The ears resemble those of <i>Rhinolophus affinis</i>, except
that they are not as large.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;Fur everywhere russet, slightly paler on ventral surface,
darker and somewhat tinged with hazel above. Ears and membranes
dark brown.</p>

<p><i>Skull and teeth.</i>&mdash;The skull and teeth exactly resemble those of
mainland specimens of <i>Rhinolophus affinis</i> except for their uniformly
smaller size.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;External measurements of type: total length, 70
(85<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>);
tail 21 (23); tibia 17.6 (24); foot 8 (10); calcar 12 (13);
forearm 43 (51); thumb 8 (8.6); second digit 32 (40); third digit
64 (77); fourth digit 53 (61); fifth digit 54 (63); ear from meatus
17 (20); ear from crown 14 (17); length of noseleaf from lip 13
(16); greatest width of noseleaf 8 (9).</p>

<p>Cranial measurements of type: greatest length 18 (23); basal
length 16 (20.4); basilar length 14.6 (18); zygomatic breadth 9 (11);
least interorbital breadth 2.4 (2.4); greatest length of braincase 10.4
(13); greatest breadth of braincase above roots of zygomata 8 (9.4);
frontopalatal depth (at middle of molar series) 4 (4.8); depth of
braincase 6 (7); mandible 11.8 (15); maxillary toothrow (exclusive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of incisor) 6.8 (9); mandibular toothrow (exclusive of incisors) 7
(9.8).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Three (one skin), all from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Rhinolophus spadix</i> is so readily distinguished from
its relatives of the <i>R. affinis</i> group that it needs no special comparisons.
It is a much smaller animal than the species from the Anambas that I
recently referred to <i>R. rouxii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
In color the latter is a dull brown not
in the least resembling the russet of <i>R. spadix</i>.</p>


<h2>CYNOPTERUS MONTANOI Robin.</h2>

<p>Five specimens (three skins) from Sirhassen. These agree so
closely with a skin and two bleached alcoholic specimens from Singapore,
which I suppose to be the same as the Malaccan <i>Cynopterus
montanoi</i>, that without more material it is impossible to distinguish
the Natuna animal from that of the southern extremity of the Malay
Peninsula. <i>Cynopterus montanoi</i> as thus understood differs from <i>C.
angulatus</i> Miller<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
of Lower Siam in its more slender skull and in the
absence of the white border of the ear, and from <i>C. titth√¶cheilus</i>
(Temminck) of Sumatra and Java in its conspicuously smaller size.</p>

<p>Eight (one in alcohol) from Sirhassen and seven (one in alcohol)
Pulo Laut. It is highly probable that these specimens represent a
species distinct from the true <i>Pteropus hypomelanus</i> of Ternate.</p>
